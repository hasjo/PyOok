# PyOok
Python3 Ook Tools

This is a suite of tools written in python to work with the Ook! language.

## Tools Description

###Conversion Tools
The first pair of tools here are conversion tools for BF/Ook!, (bftoook, ooktobf)
They are pretty self explanatory, run them with the file to be converted as an argument

###Interpreter
Interprets Ook! code. I'm pretty sure it works exactly as its supposed to.
